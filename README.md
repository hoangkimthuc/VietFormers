# VietFormers
Open source implementation of the original transformer paper in Pytorch. The purposes of this repo:
- Implement the vanilla transformer model from scratch with Pytorch
- Implement BERT, GPT, and chatGPT based on the vanilla model
- Train the models on a Vietnamese corpus.
The implementations are intended for educational purpose, hence code readability is more important than performance.
